/*
@SpringBootApplication is a convenience annotation that adds all of the following:

@Configuration: Tags the class as a source of bean definitions for the application context.

@EnableAutoConfiguration: Tells Spring Boot to start adding beans based on classpath settings, other beans, and various property settings. For example, if spring-webmvc is on the classpath, this annotation flags the application as a web application and activates key behaviors, such as setting up a DispatcherServlet.

@ComponentScan: Tells Spring to look for other components, configurations, and services in the com/example package, letting it find the controllers.

The main() method uses Spring Boot’s SpringApplication.run() method to launch an application. Did you notice that there was not a single line of XML? There is no web.xml file, either. This web application is 100% pure Java and you did not have to deal with configuring any plumbing or infrastructure.

Build an executable JAR
You can run the application from the command line with Gradle or Maven. You can also build a single executable JAR file that contains all the necessary dependencies, classes, and resources and run that. Building an executable jar makes it easy to ship, version, and deploy the service as an application throughout the development lifecycle, across different environments, and so forth.

If you use Gradle, you can run the application by using ./gradlew bootRun. Alternatively, you can build the JAR file by using ./gradlew build and then run the JAR file, as follows:

java -jar build/libs/gs-uploading-files-0.1.0.jar
If you use Maven, you can run the application by using ./mvnw spring-boot:run. Alternatively, you can build the JAR file with ./mvnw clean package and then run the JAR file, as follows:

java -jar target/gs-uploading-files-0.1.0.jar
The steps described here create a runnable JAR. You can also build a classic WAR file.

That runs the server-side piece that receives file uploads. Logging output is displayed. The service should be up and running within a few seconds.

With the server running, you need to open a browser and visit http://localhost:8080/ to see the upload form. Pick a (small) file and press Upload. You should see the success page from the controller. If you choose a file that is too large, you will get an ugly error page.

You should then see a line resembling the following in your browser window:

“You successfully uploaded <name of your file>!”

Testing Your Application

There are multiple ways to test this particular feature in our application. The following listing (from src/test/java/com/example/uploadingfiles/FileUploadTests.java) shows one example that uses MockMvc so that it does not require starting the servlet container:
